# friendfinder
Project is to create a Friend Finder app like Tinder, but for friends. We're using Node and Express servers. The user will take a survey and once submitted, they are matched with the best fitting friend.

First did the html and bootstrap for the entry and survey questions page. Then implemented js and express and node servers.
Technologies used were:
Node.js, body-parser, express NPM package, path NPM package, and stack overflow references for jQuery: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35785622/jquery-chosen-css-issue
